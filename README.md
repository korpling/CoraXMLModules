# pepperModules-CoraXMLModules
This project provides an importer to support CoraXML in the linguistic converter framework Pepper (see https://u.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper).

Pepper is a pluggable framework to convert a variety of linguistic formats (like [TigerXML](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/werkzeuge/TIGERSearch/doc/html/TigerXML.html), the [EXMARaLDA format](http://www.exmaralda.org/), [PAULA](http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/paula.html) etc.) into each other. Furthermore Pepper uses Salt (see https://github.com/korpling/salt), the graph-based meta model for linguistic data, which acts as an intermediate model to reduce the number of mappings to be implemented. That means converting data from a format _A_ to format _B_ consists of two steps. First the data is mapped from format _A_ to Salt and second from Salt to format _B_. This detour reduces the number of Pepper modules from _n<sup>2</sup>-n_ (in the case of a direct mapping) to _2n_ to handle a number of n formats.

In Pepper there are three different types of modules:
* importers (to map a format _A_ to a Salt model)
* manipulators (to map a Salt model to a Salt model, e.g. to add additional annotations, to rename things to merge data etc.)
* exporters (to map a Salt model to a format _B_).

For a simple Pepper workflow you need at least one importer and one exporter.

## Requirements
Since the here provided module is a plugin for Pepper, you need an instance of the Pepper framework. If you do not already have a running Pepper instance, click on the link below and download the latest stable version (not a SNAPSHOT):

> Note:
> Pepper is a Java based program, therefore you need to have at least Java 7 (JRE or JDK) on your system. You can download Java from https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html or http://openjdk.java.net/ .


## Install module
If this Pepper module is not yet contained in your Pepper distribution, you can easily install it. Just open a command line and enter one of the following program calls:

**Windows**
```
pepperStart.bat 
```

**Linux/Unix**
```
bash pepperStart.sh 
```

Then type in command *is* and the path from where to install the module:
```
pepper> update de.hu_berlin.german.korpling.saltnpepper::pepperModules-pepperModules-CoraXMLModules::https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/maven2/
```

## Usage
To use this module in your Pepper workflow, put the following lines into the workflow description file. Note the fixed order of xml elements in the workflow description file: &lt;importer/>, &lt;manipulator/>, &lt;exporter/>. The CoraXMLImporter is an importer module, which can be addressed by one of the following alternatives.
A detailed description of the Pepper workflow can be found on the [Pepper project site](https://u.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper). 

### a) Identify the module by name

```xml
<importer name="CoraXMLImporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
```

### b) Identify the module by formats
```xml
<importer formatName="coraXML" formatVersion="1.0" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
```

### c) Use properties
```xml
<importer name="CoraXMLImporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS">
  <property key="PROPERTY_NAME">PROPERTY_VALUE</key>
</importer>
```
